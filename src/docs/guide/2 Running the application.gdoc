h4. Building the jar

The first step is to run the [build-standalone|Scripts] script, e.g.

{code:java}
grails prod build-standalone
{code}

or

{code:java}
grails -Dgrails.env=demo build-standalone our_cool_demo.jar
{code}

If you pass the \-\-jetty flag the embedded server will be Jetty instead of the default Tomcat, for example

{code:java}
grails prod build-standalone --jetty
{code}

or

{code:java}
grails -Dgrails.env=demo build-standalone our_cool_demo.jar --jetty
{code}

You can also change the default embedded server to Jetty by placing the
following in your Config.groovy:

{code}
grails.plugins.standalone.useJetty = true
{/code}

If you've set jetty to the default, you can force a tomcat build later with the \-\-tomcat flag:

{code:java}
grails build-standalone --tomcat
{/code}


h4. Running the server

As long as the target machine has Java 5 or higher available, all you need to do next is run

{code:java}
java -jar /path/to/jar_name.jar
{code}

There are a few arguments you can pass to customize how the application runs:
# context path; if not specified it defaults to "" (the "root" context)
# host name; if not specified it defaults to "localhost"
# HTTP port; if not specified it defaults to 8080
# HTTPS port; there is no default for this, but if specified you can also specify the keystore path and password
# SSL keystore path; if not specified a temporary keystore will be generated
# SSL keystore password; required if an existing keystore path is specified

So the full syntax would be:
{code:java}
java -jar [jar path] [context path] [host name] [HTTP port] [HTTPS port] \
          [SSL keystore path] [SSL keystore password]
{code}

For example running

{code:java}
java -jar /path/to/jar_name.jar
{code}

will start a server at @http://localhost:8080/@ and

{code:java}
java -jar /path/to/jar_name.jar cool_demo localhost 9000
{code}

will start a server at @http://localhost:9000/cool_demo@

{code:java}
java -jar /path/to/jar_name.jar cool_demo localhost 8080 8443
{code}

will start a server at @http://localhost:8080/cool_demo@ and will also support SSL at @https://localhost:8443/cool_demo@
